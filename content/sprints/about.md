## What is a documentation sprint?
We will spend a day working together in trying to improve the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) documentation. Each of the participants will choose one documentation piece (a.k.a. _docstring_) to work on (or more if time), and will submit the fix to the [pandas repository](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) with our help. 

This is a great opportunity to make your first open source contribution, to do some networking, and to help improve the pandas library!

## Exactly when and where is the sprint?
- Day: 21st of March, 2020
- Time: 9am until 6pm
- Location: In Berlin, Germany, at [Comtravo Gmbh](https://www.comtravo.com/de/) (thanks for hosting us!)
