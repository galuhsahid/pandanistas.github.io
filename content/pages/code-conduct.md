title: code of conduct

We are dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.

If you while participating of this community (in online platforms or in-person events) suffer any form of harassment, or become aware of someone else being harassed, please contact a member of the _pandanistas_ team.
